    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll make use of SQLAlchemy to execute CRUD operations on a SQL database!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identify the steps needed to use SQLAlchemy with a database\n",
    "* Understand and explain the concept of an Object Relational Mapper\n",
    "* Execute CRUD operations on a database using SQLAlchemy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll make use of our newfound SQLAlchemy knowledge to create a database, populate it with data, and write queries to retrieve objects containing the information we want. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by setting up our database. For this lesson, we're going to create then database described in the following ERD:\n",

    "**_Question:_**\n",

    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line:\n",
    "________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers have a 1-to-1 relationship with shopping carts, while shopping carts have 1-to-many relationship with items.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining Our Mappings\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin by importing everything we need to create our database and structure our mappings so that they look like the tables in the ERD.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Import everything from sqlalchemy\n",
    "* Import `declarative_base` \n",

    "* The `relationship` that each class has to other classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we haven't explicitly covered how to create relationships, it's not hard--just a single line of code.  This is a great opportunity to get some practice finding what you need from documentation, and the SQLAlchemy documentation is really informative and easy to understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be creating a 1-to-1 relationship (Customer <--> ShoppingCart), and a 1-to-many relationship (ShoppingCart <--> Item). Take a look at the documenation for creating relationships and see if you can figure out how to set this up!\n",

    "\n",
    "* Complete the `Customer`, `ShoppingCart`, and `Item` classes. \n",
    "* Give each class the correct table name ('customer', 'shoppingCart', and 'Item')\n",
    "* Define the correct columns for each class, with the appropriate data types, and set the appropriate primary key and foreign keys.\n",
    "* Set the appropriate relationships between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Hint:_** When setting the relationships, pay attention to the capitalization in the documenation--in some parts, you reference the name of the class, while in others, you reference the name of the table!\n",
